Changes so far
--------------

Please check out `screens/GoogleLoginScreen.js`.

The only change is replacing the `result` variable.  The relevant docs can be found [here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/google).  Scroll to the bottom.

Warning
-------

I did this test for a group project.  We ended up not going forward with it.  While the app does seem to authenticate with Google, I never figured out the next step.
